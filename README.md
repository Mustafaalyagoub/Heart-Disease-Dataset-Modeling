# Heart-Disease-Dataset
In this project we will use supervised and unsupervised learning for heart disease with different algorithms. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. \n
Algorithms that is used:\n
Supervised Learning (Predictive model):\n
1- Multi Class Perceptron Classifier, 2- Linear Kernel Function
Unsupervised Learning
1- K-Means Clustering , 2- DB Scan
