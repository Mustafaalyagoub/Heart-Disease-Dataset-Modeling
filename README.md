# Heart-Disease-Dataset
In this project we will use supervised and unsupervised learning for heart disease with different algorithms. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.


## Algorithms that is used:

### Supervised Learning (Predictive model):

1- Multi Class Perceptron Classifier (MLP Classifier) , 2- SVM - Linear Kernel Function


### Unsupervised Learning:
1- K-Means Clustering , 2- DB Scan

## Summary:
Our best model is the MLP Classifier with 6x6x4 neurons with an accuracy of 84% on predicting the heart disease
