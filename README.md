# Heart-Disease-Dataset
In this project we will use supervised and unsupervised learning for heart disease with different algorithms. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
Algorithms that is used:
Supervised Learning (Predictive model):
1- Multi Class Perceptron Classifier, 2- Linear Kernel Function
Unsupervised Learning
1- K-Means Clustering , 2- DB Scan
